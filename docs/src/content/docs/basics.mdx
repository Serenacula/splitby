## What is it?

splitby splits text into fields and returns just the pieces you ask for.

```sh
echo "apple,banana,cherry" | splitby , 2
# banana
```

## Delimiters

Delimiters are search strings that we split the text by. You can pass one explicitly:

```sh
echo "a b c" | splitby -d " " 2
# b
```

Or implicitly drop the flag, and splitby will detect it:

```sh
echo "a,b,c" | splitby , 1 3
# a,c
```

## Regex delimiters

Regex delimiters are also supported, by surrounding the string with forward slashes:

```sh
echo "a   b   c" | splitby -d "/\\s+/" 2
# b
```

## Selections

Selections are one-based indexes:

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " 1
# a
```

Ranges work too:

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " 2-3
# b c
```

Negative indexes count from the end:

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " -1
# d
```

## Multiple selections

You can list multiple selections with spaces:

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " 1 3-4
# a c d
```
