## What is it?

splitby splits text into fields and returns just the pieces you ask for.

```sh
echo "apple,banana,cherry" | splitby , 2
# banana
```

## Delimiters

Delimiters are regular expressions. You can pass one explicitly:

```sh
echo "a   b   c" | splitby -d "\\s+" 2
# b
```

Or implicitly, splitby will detect it:

```sh
echo "a,b,c" | splitby , 1 3
# a c
```

## Selections

Selections are one-based indexes:

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " 1
# a
```

Ranges work too:

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " 2-3
# b c
```

Negative indexes count from the end:

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " -1
# d
```

## Multiple selections

You can list multiple selections with spaces:

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " 1 3-4
# a c d
```
