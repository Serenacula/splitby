## Input modes

### Per-line (default)

splitby reads one line at a time and applies selections to each line.

```sh
printf "a,b\nc,d\n" | splitby -d "," 1
# a
# c
```

### Whole-string (`-w`, `--whole-string`)

Treats the entire input as a single record. This is useful when your delimiter is `\n` or you want to operate across line breaks.

```sh
printf "a,b\nc,d\n" | splitby -w -d "\n" 2
# c,d
```

### Zero-terminated (`-z`, `--zero-terminated`)

Reads and writes NUL-delimited records. This is useful when piping from tools like `find -print0`.

```sh
printf "name,age\0alice,30\0" | splitby -z -d "," 1
# name
# alice
```

## Selection modes

### Fields (default)

Splits by a regex delimiter and selects fields. This is the most common mode.

### Characters (`-c`, `--characters`)

Selects by visible characters (grapheme clusters), not bytes.

```sh
echo "café" | splitby -c 1-3
# caf
```

### Bytes (`-b`, `--bytes`)

Selects raw byte offsets. Useful for binary or fixed-width data.

```sh
echo "abc" | splitby -b 1-2
# ab
```

## Selection modifiers

### Invert (`--invert`)

Outputs everything except the selections you specify.

```sh
echo "a b c d" | splitby -d " " --invert 2
# a c d
```
