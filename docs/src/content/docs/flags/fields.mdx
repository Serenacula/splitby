title: Fields
description: Explicitly select fields by delimiter.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --fields [selection...]
```

## What it does

Splits the input into fields, using a delimiter. This is the default if no other selection mode is specified.

This flag is only useful when changing the default behaviour or using aliases.

## Examples

```sh
echo "a,b,c" | splitby --characters --fields -d "," 2
# b
```
