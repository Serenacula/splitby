title: Strict range order
description: Error if a range starts after it ends.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --strict-range-order [selection...]
splitby --no-strict-range-order [selection...]
```

## What it does

When enabled, ranges like `3-1` are errors instead of silently ignored.

This mode is on by default.

## Examples

```sh
echo "a b" | splitby -d " " --strict-range-order 2-1
# end index (1) is less than start index (2) in selection 2-1
```
