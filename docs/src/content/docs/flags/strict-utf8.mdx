title: Strict UTF-8
description: Treat invalid UTF-8 as an error in character mode.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --strict-utf8 [selection...]
```

## What it does

In character and field mode, `--strict-utf8` requires valid UTF-8 input. If input is invalid, splitby returns an error instead of replacing invalid bytes.

## Examples

```sh
printf "a\xff" | splitby -c --strict-utf8 1
```
