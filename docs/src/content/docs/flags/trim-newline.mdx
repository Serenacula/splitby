description: Omit the final trailing newline from output.

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --trim-newline [selection...]
```

## What it does

By default, splitby writes a newline after each record. `--trim-newline` removes the final trailing newline from the very last record.

## Examples

```sh
printf "a\nb\n" | splitby --trim-newline -d " " 1
```
