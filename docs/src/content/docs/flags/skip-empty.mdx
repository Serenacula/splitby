title: Skip empty
description: Control whether empty fields count as fields.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --skip-empty [selection...]
splitby --no-skip-empty [selection...]
```

Short forms:

```sh
splitby -e [selection...]
splitby -E [selection...]
```

## What it does

When enabled, empty fields are ignored during indexing and counting. This is useful when the delimiter can appear multiple times in a row.

## Examples

```sh
echo "a,,b" | splitby -d "," -e 2
# b
```

```sh
echo "a,,b" | splitby -d "," -E 2
# (empty)
```
