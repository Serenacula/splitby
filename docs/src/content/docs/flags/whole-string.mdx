title: Whole string
description: Treat the entire input as a single record.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby -w [selection...]
```

## What it does

Processes the full input as one record, which is useful when your delimiter is a newline or when you want cross-line selections.

## Examples

```sh
printf "a\nb\nc\n" | splitby -w -d "\n" 2
# b
```

# Gotchas

- Because the input is treated as a single record, this mode does not take advantage of multithreading.
