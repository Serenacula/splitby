title: Delimiter
description: Choose how fields are separated in field mode.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby -d "< /REGEX/ | LITERAL >" [selection...]
# or
splitby -d "< /REGEX/ | LITERAL >" [selection...]
```

By default, splitby will assume the first unrecognised argument it comes across is a delimiter. This is called an implicit delimiter.

```sh
splitby "<REGEX>" [selection...]
```

## What it does

Splits each record into fields using a regular expression. The delimiter is required for field mode unless it can be auto-detected from the first argument.

## Examples

Split on a literal comma:

```sh
echo "a,b,c" | splitby -d "," 2
# b
```

Split on regex whitespace:

```sh
echo "a   b   c" | splitby -d "/\\s+/" 3
# c
```

## Gotchas

- Shells often eat backslashes. Use single quotes or double-escape (`'\\s+'`).
- If a delimiter has already been set, implicit delimiters will instead error.
