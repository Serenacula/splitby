title: Delimiter (-d, --delimiter)
description: Choose how fields are separated in field mode.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby -d "<REGEX>" [selection...]
```

In field mode, you can also provide the delimiter as the first argument:

```sh
splitby "<REGEX>" [selection...]
```

## What it does

Splits each record into fields using a regular expression. The delimiter is required for field mode unless it can be auto-detected from the first argument.

## Examples

Split on commas:

```sh
echo "a,b,c" | splitby -d "," 2
# b
```

Split on whitespace:

```sh
echo "a   b   c" | splitby -d "\\s+" 3
# c
```

## Gotchas

- Shells often eat backslashes. Use single quotes or double-escape (`'\\s+'`).
- If the first argument is a valid selection, splitby treats it as a selection and expects `-d`.
