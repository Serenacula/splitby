title: Strict
description: Toggle all strict behaviors at once.

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --strict [selection...]
splitby --no-strict [selection...]
```

## What it does

`--strict` enables all strict checks:

- `--strict-bounds`
- `--strict-return`
- `--strict-range-order`
- `--strict-utf8`

`--no-strict` disables them all.

## Examples

```sh
echo "a b" | splitby -d " " --strict 3
# strict bounds error: index (3) out of bounds, must be between 1 and 2
```
