title: Bytes
description: Select byte offsets instead of fields.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby -b [selection...]
```

## What it does

Selects raw bytes by position. This is useful for binary or fixed-width data.

Note: You can use [`--placeholder`](/flags/placeholder) to guarantee the output's data width.

## Examples

```sh
printf "abcdef" | splitby -b 2-4
# bcd
```
