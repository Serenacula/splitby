title: Align
description: Align output fields to a consistent width.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --align [selection...]
```

## What it does

Aligns the start of each field across records by padding shorter fields with spaces. This is useful for creating columnar output that's easier to read.

## Examples

```sh
echo "apple,banana,cherry\na,b,c" | splitby -d "," --align 1 2
# apple,banana
# a,    b
```

## Gotchas

- Only works in per-line mode with field mode.
