title: Characters
description: Select visible characters (grapheme clusters).
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby -c [selection...]
```

## What it does

Selects by characters.

Note: Unlike `cut`, this does not use codepoints. Characters are selected by visible grapheme clusters, which means a letter like 'é' counts as a single letter.

## Examples

```sh
echo "café" | splitby -c 3-4
# fé
```
