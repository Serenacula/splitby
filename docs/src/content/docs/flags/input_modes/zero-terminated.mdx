description: Use NUL as the record separator.

## Syntax

```sh
splitby -z [selection...]
```

## What it does

Reads and writes NUL-delimited records. This is handy for `find -print0` or `xargs -0` style pipelines.

## Examples

```sh
printf "first,second\0third,fourth\0" | splitby -z -d "," 1
# first
# third
```
