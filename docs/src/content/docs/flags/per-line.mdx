title: Per-line
description: Process each line as a separate record.

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --per-line [selection...]
```

## What it does

Each input line is processed independently. This is the default if no other input mode has been set.

This flag is only useful when changing the default behaviour or using aliases.

## Examples

```sh
printf "a,b\nc,d\n" | splitby -d "," --per-line 2
# b
# d
```
