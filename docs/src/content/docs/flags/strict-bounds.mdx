title: Strict bounds
description: Error if a selection goes out of range.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --strict-bounds [selection...]
splitby --no-strict-bounds [selection...]
```

## What it does

When enabled, out-of-range selections become errors instead of silently clamping or skipping.

## Examples

```sh
echo "a b" | splitby -d " " --strict-bounds 5
# strict bounds error: index (5) out of bounds. must be between 1 and 2
```
