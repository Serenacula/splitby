title: Align
description: Align output fields to a consistent width.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --align [selection...]
```

## What it does

Aligns the start of each field across records by padding shorter fields with spaces.

Align optionally accepts several different modes:

- `left`: The default, delimiters are aligned and fields at the left of their column.
- `right`: Delimiters are aligned and fields at the right of their column.
- `squash`: Padding is placed after the delimiter, so the first letter of each field is aligned.

## Examples

### Left (the default mode)

```sh
echo "apple|banana|cherry\na|b|c" | splitby -d "|" --align 1 2
# apple|banana
# a    |b
```

### Right

```sh
echo "apple|banana|cherry\na|b|c" | splitby -d "|" --align=right 1 2
# apple|banana
#     a|     b
```

### Squash

```sh
echo "apple,banana,cherry\na,b,c" | splitby -d "," --align=squash 1 2
# apple,banana
# a,    b
```

## Gotchas

- Only works in per-line mode with field mode.
- Because it must do a first-pass to work out column widths before processing, this flag can limit efficiency in large datasets.
