title: Join (-j, --join)
description: Override how selections are joined together.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --join "<STRING>" [selection...]
```

## What it does

By default, splitby tries to preserve the original delimiter between selections in field mode. `--join` replaces that behavior with your custom string.

## Examples

```sh
echo "a,b,c" | splitby -d "," --join " | " 1 3
# a | c
```

## Gotchas

- `--join` affects separators between selections, not within ranges.
- In whole-string mode, the default separator is a newline. `--join` replaces it.
