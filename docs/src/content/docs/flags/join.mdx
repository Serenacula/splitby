title: Join
description: Override how selections are joined together.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --join "<STRING>" [selection...]
```

## What it does

By default, splitby tries to preserve the original delimiter between selections in field mode. `--join` replaces that behavior with your custom string.

Join also accepts a number of special keywords.

- `auto`: Apply the default behaviour of trying `after-previous`, then trying `before-next` then falling back to a space.
- `first`: Use the first delimiter in the record
- `last`: Use the last delimiter in the record
- `after-previous`: Use the delimiter after the previously printed field
- `before-next`: Use the delimiter before the next printed field
- `space`: Use a single space, equivalent to `" "`
- `none`: Use an empty join, equivalent to `""`

## Examples

### Custom string join

Join selections with a custom string:

```sh
echo "a,b,c" | splitby -d "," --join " | " 1 3
# a | c
```

```sh
echo "apple,banana,cherry" | splitby -d "," -j " -> " 1-3
# apple -> banana -> cherry
```

### Join keywords

Use special keywords:

#### `auto` (default behavior)

Tries to preserve original delimiters, falling back to space when no delimiter is available:

```sh
# When delimiters exist between selections, preserves them
echo "apple,banana,cherry" | splitby -d "," --join auto 1 3
# apple,cherry

# Falls back to space when no delimiter is available
echo "apple" | splitby -d "," --join auto 1 1
# apple apple
```

#### `first` (first delimiter)

Uses the first delimiter found in the record:

```sh
echo "apple,banana;cherry:date" | splitby -d "[,;:]" --join first 3 4
# cherry,date
```

#### `last` (last delimiter)

Uses the last delimiter found in the record:

```sh
# Multiple delimiter types - uses the last one found
echo "apple,banana;cherry:date" | splitby -d "[,;:]" --join last 1 2
# apple:banana
```

#### `after-previous` (delimiter after previous field)

Uses the delimiter that immediately follows the previously selected field:

```sh
# Uses the comma after "apple" (field 1)
echo "apple,banana;cherry:date" | splitby -d "[,;:]" --join after-previous 1 3 1
# apple,cherry:apple
```

#### `before-next` (delimiter before next field)

Uses the delimiter that immediately precedes the next selected field:

```sh
# Uses the comma before "cherry" (field 3)
echo "apple,banana;cherry:date" | splitby -d "[,;:]" --join before-next 1 4 2
# apple:date,banana
```

#### `none` (no separator)

Concatenates selections with no separator between them:

```sh
echo "apple,banana,cherry" | splitby -d "," --join none 1 3
# applecherry
```

#### `space` (single space)

Always uses a single space, regardless of original delimiters:

```sh
# Original delimiter is comma, but output uses space
echo "apple,banana,cherry" | splitby -d "," --join space 1 3
# apple cherry
```

## Gotchas

- `after-previous` and `before-next` fallback to a space, if there is no delimiter available. I might change this depending on feedback.
