title: Count
description: Output the number of fields, characters, or bytes.
---

## Syntax

```sh
splitby --count
```

## What it does

Returns the count of items in the current selection mode:

- fields in field mode
- characters in character mode
- bytes in byte mode

The count is performed per record, so by default it will count for each line. If you wish to count across a document, you can use `--whole-string` mode.

## Examples

```sh
echo "a,b,c\napple,banana" | splitby "," --count
> 3
> 2
```

```sh
echo "café" | splitby -c --count
# 4
```

```sh
echo "a,b,c\napple,banana" | splitby --whole-string "," --count
> 4
```

## Gotchas

- Selections and selection-altering flags like `--invert` and `--placeholder` are ignored for counts.
