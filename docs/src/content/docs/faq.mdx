## Why does `\s+` not work?

Some shells treat backslashes as escapes. Use single quotes or double-escape:

```sh
splitby -d '\s+' 1
splitby -d "\\s+" 1
```

## Why are selections joined with spaces sometimes?

When `--join` is not set, splitby uses a priority rule:

1. delimiter after the previous selection
2. delimiter before the next selection
3. fallback space

Use `--join` for consistent output.
