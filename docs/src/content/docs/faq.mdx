## Why does `\s+` not work?

Most shells treat backslashes as escapes. Use single quotes or double-escape:

```sh
splitby -d '\\s+' 1
splitby -d "\\s+" 1
```

If you pass the delimiter as the first argument, quoting still applies:

```sh
splitby '\\s+' 1
```

## Why did splitby treat my delimiter as a selection?

If the first argument looks like a selection (`1`, `2-4`, `-1`, or `1,3`), splitby assumes it is a selection and expects `-d` for the delimiter.

To force a delimiter, use `-d`:

```sh
splitby -d "," 1
```

## Why are selections joined with spaces sometimes?

When `--join` is not set, splitby uses a priority rule:

1. delimiter after the previous selection
2. delimiter before the next selection
3. fallback space

Use `--join` for consistent output.
