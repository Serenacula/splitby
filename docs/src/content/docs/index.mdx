import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Quick start

```sh
echo "name,age,city" | splitby , 1 3
# name city
```

If you prefer explicit flags:

```sh
echo "name,age,city" | splitby -d "," 1 3
```

splitby uses readable selections like `1`, `2-4`, and `-1`, and it works just as well on whitespace:

```sh
ls -l | splitby "\\s+" 9
```
